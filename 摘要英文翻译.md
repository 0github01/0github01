## Abstract of this article

Central idiopathic hypersomnia was first described worldwide in 1976 [1] as a rare condition of persistent lethargy (distinct from narcolepsy type 1, a rare disease whose scientific pathology is well established as a result of hypothalamic hypoorexin secretion deficiency). Because its pathology is still unknown in scientific research, it is difficult to obtain accurate diagnosis and accurate treatment for patients. At present, it is very important and urgent to explore the corresponding pathological hypothesis and make breakthroughs in pathological research.


**According to the Expert Consensus on Clinical Diagnosis and Treatment of Daytime hypersomnia published by the China Sleep Research Society, the estimated number of people affected by "central Idiopathic hypersomnia" in China is 50,000** (the prevalence rate mentioned in the consensus is 0.02‰~0.05‰, which is converted into the estimated value of population) [2]. In addition, "atypical depression" (also called "hypersomnia depression" in some cases) is an important subtype of depression and accounts for a large proportion, considering that this population is likely to overlap with the "central Idiopathic hypersomnia" population, Considering that the patients with narcolepsy type 2 and severe chronic fatigue syndrome whose pathologies are unknown in scientific research are also likely to overlap with the population of "central Idiopathic hypersomnia", the number of people affected by "central Idiopathic hypersomnia" in China is likely to exceed the estimated 50,000.

However, for this central disease (involving central lesions, the per-capita general impact should not be low), what is the number of patients with moderate and severe disease in China? How severe is the average individual harm? Based on an estimate of 50,000 patients in China, there is no "central Idiopathic hypersomnia" patient organization in China so far (it should be noted that there are many more minority groups with rare diseases in China). Is it because "patients generally have little influence, so it is not necessary to establish patient organizations" or "patients with moderate and severe diseases are seriously disturbed by 7*24 hours sleep drunkness/non-alcoholic drunkness/brain fog, and it is difficult for patients and their families to take the initiative to form patient organizations"? At present, there is no clear answer to these basic questions, and the root cause of which is the unknown pathology in scientific research. Before

Continuing to explain the importance of pathological hypothesis, **I would like to make a brief self-introduction. The author is a patient with severe 7 * 24 hour sleep drunkeness/non-alcoholic drunkeness, with symptoms lasting for many years (but no specific lesions were found), clinically classified as severe chronic fatigue syndrome or central idiopathic drowsiness.** In recent years, the author is very concerned about and very much want to promote the scientific research and development of "idiopathic hypersomnia" and its science popularization in China, such as the first retained version of "idiopathic hypersomnia" Baidu encyclopedia entry was submitted by me in nearly half a year.

Here, the historical origin of "idiopathic hypersomnia" being identified and recognized by the scientific and clinical community is expounded, and the importance and urgency of pathologic research and exploration of "idiopathic hypersomnia" is further explained. Bedrich Roth played a huge role in the worldwide recognition and recognition of idiopathic hypersomnia as an independent disorder, rather than a psychological disorder. Ross contributed so much to "idiopathic hypersomnia" that his contributions are probably still in the top five or three of all dead or living scholars in the world (" idiopathic hypersomnia "is a rare disease, the total number of scholars studied is often far less than the common disease), and here are some of his views on central idiopathic hypersomnia. **In 1976, Ross published "narcolepsy and Narcolepsy: A Review and classification of 642 Individual observational cases", which was the first worldwide reference to his identification of idiopathic hypersomnia. In his description, it can be divided into two forms: While the single symptom is characterized by excessive daytime sleepiness, the multiple symptom has more complex symptoms such as persistent sleep drunkness** (sleep drunkness/non-alcoholic drunkness is now also known as brain fog on some occasions, and the duration can even be said to be 7*24 hours continuous, author's note). **The 642 cases included 71 monosymptomatic and 103 multisymptomatic cases of idiopathic hypersomnia [3,4].**

Ross also differentiates between sporadic sleep drunkness and idiopathic hypersomnia, noting that "sleep drunkness can sometimes occur in anyone waking up after sleep deprivation, being in an unfamiliar environment, taking sedatives, taking hypnotics, or drinking. It is also characteristic of sleepwalkers who wake up during the night, and sleepwalkers are known to be deep sleepers... However, in patients with multisymptomatic idiopathic hypersomnia, sleep drunkenness occurs on a daily basis." [3,4]. All of these types of sleep drunkenness can be understood as sleep disorders or sleep deprivation, and by comparison of sleep drunkenness (at least as intuitive as Rose's description of the number of times), sleep deprivation in patients with multi-symptom idiopathic hypersomnia may be more severe than sleep deprivation in patients with the most severe insomnia (note). At present, it is very important and urgent to explore the pathological hypothesis and make breakthroughs in pathological research.

In this context, The pathological hypothesis proposed in this paper may be the best one in the world to explain the phenomenon of "central Idiopathic hypersomnia patient population with clinical failure to identify the disease and accompanied by severe 7*24 sleep drunkenness/non-alcoholic drunkenness/brain fog" (as for the single-symptom idiopathic hypersomnia population, the symptoms can be understood as less than 0.5 bottle of beer or less beer disturbance). As for the monosymptomatic idiopathic hypersomnia group, the symptom of "sleep drunkness" can be interpreted as "sleep drunkness", so it is difficult to detect sleep drunkness by increasing sleep time first, so this hypothesis can also be explained). This article is elaborated in details, hoping to arousse the attention of relevant professionals in the industry.
**The pathological hypothesis proposed by the
author is as follows: "hypothalamus and other parts control the awakening nerve nucleus ultra-small blood vessel lesions (such as small blood vessel blockage, etc.) resulting in excessive carbon dioxide in a small range further leads to central idiopathic hypersomnia whose current scientific research and pathology are unknown".** In this paper, the data of carbon dioxide and oxygen blood diffusion are attached and the calculation analysis shows that "this kind of small vessel disease is easy to cause carbon dioxide excess before oxygen deficiency near the nerve nucleus controlling arousal under occasional circumstances." The idea that excessive carbon dioxide, rather than insufficient oxygen, is more likely to be the culprit of some narcolepsy disorders such as sleep-disordered breathing syndrome belongs to a neglected corner of the current scientific and clinical community.

**I propose this pathological hypothesis with some (weak or strong) supporting evidence:**

1. Among the postulated anesthetic sources for the mass phenomenon of "no clinically detected lesion and even sleeping drunkness/non-alcoholic drunkness/brain fog for 7*24 hours a day", **perhaps none is more worthy of priority exploration than that of excessive carbon dioxide as a natural daily anesthetic source (as a sub-view of this hypothesis).**

2. According to a paper published by Zhili Huang research group of Fudan University, the pathological hypothesis that lesions of arousal control nuclei such as the paravullary nucleus of the hypothalamus less than 1MM cause obvious chronic sleepiness that can not be detected by current clinical methods is completely possible despite the rare probability. An article "Huang Zhili's research group found that the awakening new nucleus hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus regulates wakefulness and sleepiness" [5] from Fudan University mentioned that "Professor Wang Zan's team found that the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus in three patients with severe sleepiness (more than 20 hours of sleep per day)... Impairment of function ". In humans, the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus is 3-5 mm in size (the hypothalamus is about the size of a big finger). The paper mentions that damage to the paraventricular nucleus can lead to "more than 20 hours of sleep per day", and lesions smaller than 1MM are almost invisible at 3T. Furthermore, even if the world's most high-end clinical magnetic resonance equipment scans this part of the body, due to human breathing and heartbeat interference, the 1MM resolution limit is not necessarily improved much). Therefore, it is possible that lesions of arousal control nuclei such as the paravullar nucleus of the hypothalamus, which are smaller than 1MM, can cause significant chronic sleepiness that is not detected by current clinical methods. The proportion of patients is relatively low (the incidence is very low) but the total number of patients is estimated to be large in absolute numbers.

3. My countermeasure against this pathological hypothesis is, in my own opinion, effective in the long term and much more effective than pure stimulants such as espresso. The main way I have taken to hedge carbon dioxide against this pathological hypothesis for a long time is "non-hunger state (preferably after satiation) + small fan side blowing nose-hole (at first, it was oxygen inhalation, but in the last two years, it was changed to small fan side blowing nose-hole. Oxygen inhalation should just drive away the exhaled high concentration of carbon dioxide and play a role. This method can obviously eliminate sleep drunkness/non-alcoholic drunkness/brain fog (the effect is still limited), and the pure stimulation of espresso feels equivalent to short-term arousal (for example, within half an hour) and long-term basically no arousal (for example, after a short-term arousal, it is more tired within half an hour to one or two hours).
Once this pathological hypothesis can be confirmed (e.g. repeated in animal studies), then the social value of central idiopathic hypersomnia should be great, at least this group of people can take similar ways to reduce sleep drunkenness/non-alcoholic drunkenness/brain fog symptoms. Rather than purely long-term stimulants (which may have significant side effects even in healthy people, such as drinking strong coffee every day for years), patient organizations or clinical or scientific institutions should be encouraged to consider the potential value of this pathological hypothesis once it is confirmed.

**Abstract note 1**:Central idiopathic hypersomnia, which was first described in 1976, is not necessarily consistent with the current classification standard. Due to unknown scientific research and pathology, accurate classification is simply difficult to do, and it is possible that the definition of the term has changed or greatly changed (now it is generally classified by sleep monitoring to monitor the night sleep time, etc.).

**Abstract note 2**: In my opinion, the idiopathic hypersomnia with sleep drunkenness described by Ross is generally more severe than that of patients with single symptoms. In this paper, it is argued that patients with sleep drunkenness every day correspond to patients with moderate severe symptoms, and patients with single symptoms correspond to patients with mild symptoms. It is not scientific to classify and distinguish the severity mainly by whether the night sleep time is 9 hours or 10 hours. A better way to distinguish the severity of sleep drunkness and non-alcoholic drunkness should be the long-term subjective degree or even the objective degree (the objective degree is difficult to break through in the near future due to the unknown pathology in scientific research; Short-term subjective judgment is easy to distort, drunk people may also swear that they are not drunk at all, a good long-term subjective judgment method can eliminate large short-term bias).
